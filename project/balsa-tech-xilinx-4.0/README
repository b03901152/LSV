balsa-tech-xilinx is a Balsa technology-description package
which generates Verilog netlists (from balsa-netlist) for
Xilinx FPGAs.

To install this package first install Balsa and add Balsa's bin
directory to your path.  Then:

1) ./configure

This will use balsa-config to find the Balsa installation directory
and the correct `tech' directory to install into.

2) make install

Installs this package and makes the new Balsa technology `xilinx'

To use this technology, set your BALSATECH environment variable
to `xilinx'.
