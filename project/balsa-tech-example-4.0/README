balsa-tech-example is an example Balsa technology-description
package which generates Verilog netlists (from balsa-netlist).
This technology can be used with the gate simulations models in
example-cells.v to allow Balsa to be used without a specific target
technology.

To install this package first install Balsa and add Balsa's bin
directory to your path.  Then:

1) ./configure

This will use balsa-config to find the Balsa installation directory
and the correct `tech' directory to install into.

2) make install

Installs this package and makes the new Balsa technology `example'

To use this technology, set your BALSATECH environment variable
to `example'.  Styles `four_b_rb' and `dual_b' are supported (with
BALSATECHs of `example/four_b_rb' and `example/dual_b').
